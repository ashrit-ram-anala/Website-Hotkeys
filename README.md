# Website Hotkeys

This is a Chrome Extension that allows a user to create faster ways of getting to their favorite websites. They can assign quick and unique hotkeys to websites or parts of a website that may be tedious to get to. All hotkeys are stored locally and are available to view through the extension popup. This is different from bookmarks as it is faster and there is no need to navigate through folders to search for bookmarks when all of the hotkeys are available right on your keyboard.
